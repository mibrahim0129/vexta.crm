      <p>
        A CRM that follows the deal, not the contact.
        <br /><br />
        Vexta is a real estate CRM built for agents, by agents—designed to keep relationships strong without turning them into work. Real estate is driven by trust, timing, and momentum, and Vexta focuses on what actually matters: the deal.
        <br /><br />
        Instead of organizing your business around contacts, Vexta is structured around active opportunities. Every conversation, task, document, and follow-up lives within the deal itself, allowing agents to stay organized while keeping interactions natural and personal. The system works quietly in the background, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.
        <br /><br />
        Vexta helps agents stay present with their clients, confident in their process, and focused on moving deals forward. By combining real-world agent experience with intelligent automation, Vexta delivers a smarter way to manage transactions—without losing the human side of real estate.
